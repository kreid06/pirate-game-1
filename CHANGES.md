# Pirate Game - Change Summary

## Changes Made to Ship Collision Box & Walkable Area

1. **Fixed Physics Offset Implementation**
   - Set the physicsOffsetX value to 100px to align the physics collision box with visual hull
   - Fixed the position calculations in `update()` and `applyRudder()` methods 
   - Updated `isPositionOnDeck()` method to correctly account for the physics offset
   - Players can now walk on the entire visible deck area including the bow section

2. **Enhanced Debug Visualization**
   - Updated `drawDebugCollisionBox()` method to clearly show physics and visual boundaries
   - Added color-coding: red for physics body, yellow for walkable area, green/red for walkable test points
   - Added informative coordinate labels showing exact positions of both physics and visual centers
   - Added purple dashed line showing the offset relationship between physics and visual centers
   - Improved text labels with precise positioning values and offset information

3. **Added Walkable Area Test Grid**
   - Created `testWalkableArea()` method to visualize the walkable deck area
   - Shows green dots for walkable positions and red dots for non-walkable areas
   - Visualizes obstacle avoidance zones for masts, wheel, etc.
   - Press 'G' to toggle the walkable area test visualization

4. **Improved Debug Feedback**
   - Enhanced `isPositionOnDeck()` method with detailed debug logging
   - Added on-screen indicator showing whether a player is on a valid deck position
   - Created documentation explaining all debug visualizations in DEBUG_GUIDE.md

## Previous Changes to Ship Mechanics

1. **Increased Maximum Sail Angle Range**
   - Changed the maximum sail rotation angle from 30째 to 45째 degrees in each direction
   - Updated the `rotateSails` method to support the new range
   - Updated the ShipModule interface documentation

2. **Improved Wind Physics & Ship Movement**
   - Increased the force magnitude applied to the ship (from 0.005 to 0.01)
   - Added calculations that consider both wind direction and ship orientation
   - Enhanced force vector calculation to make wind effects more responsive to sail angles
   - Added angle bonus for sails positioned at the edges of the range (up to 20% more efficiency)
   - Added visual indicators to show sail efficiency via color coding
   - Fixed 90-degree offset in sail efficiency calculations for more realistic sailing mechanics

3. **Enhanced Ship Physics**
   - Reduced ship density and friction for more responsive movement
   - Adjusted velocity decay to prevent the ship from stopping too quickly
   - Added different movement behaviors based on whether sails are open or closed

4. **Improved Wind Visualization**
   - Added compass-like wind indicator with direction and strength
   - Enhanced sail rendering to show valid rotation range and current angle
   - Added visual feedback showing sail efficiency through color changes

5. **Dynamic Wind Patterns**
   - Enhanced wind simulation with more natural changes in speed and direction
   - Added occasional wind shifts and gusts for more interesting sailing scenarios
   - Implemented cyclic wind patterns for a more realistic sailing experience

6. **Forward-Only Ship Movement**
   - Modified ship physics to ensure it only moves forward in the direction it's facing
   - Ship turning now depends solely on rudder control
   - Ship speed now correlates directly with the wind-sail angle effectiveness

7. **Improved Ship Turning Mechanics**
   - Reduced overall turning power for more realistic ship handling
   - Made rudder turning rate gradual and dependent on current ship speed
   - Correlated turning effectiveness with sail power and wind conditions
   - Added UI indicator showing current turning responsiveness
   - Implemented physics that make ships turn more sluggishly at low speeds
   - Reduced the maximum ship turning speed by 10 fold for significantly more realistic naval handling

8. **Predictable Wind System**
   - Implemented a predictable wind pattern that rotates clockwise
   - Wind completes a full 360째 cycle every 5 minutes
   - Wind strength varies based on direction:
     - Strong winds when blowing north-south
     - Weak winds when blowing east-west
     
9. **Improved Ship Collision Boundaries**
   - Extended the bow collision area by approximately 1/8 of the ship length (~70px)
   - Increased the ship's physics body width from 550px to 620px to better match visual size
   - Adjusted the ship boundaries to allow walking closer to the edges (98% of visual space)
   - Enhanced the bow and stern curves to better match the visual representation:
     - Updated control points for more accurate quadratic curve boundaries
     - Added improved mathematical calculations to follow the hull shape
   - Implemented debugging visualizations to verify collision boundaries match visual hull
   - Added small random variations to prevent perfectly mechanical feel

9. **Free Movement on Ship Deck**
   - Added ability for player to walk freely on ship deck when not at the steering wheel
   - Implemented `E` key to toggle between steering wheel and deck walking
   - Added collision detection to keep player on ship's deck while walking
   - Updated player movement and ship controls to handle the new states
   - Ship controls (sails, rudder) only accessible when at steering wheel
   - Firing cannons possible from anywhere on the deck
   - Added visual HUD indicators for player location status (At Wheel/On Deck)
   - Boarding/exiting ship still handled with the `F` key

## Controls & Gameplay
- **W/S**: Open/Close Sails
- **A/D**: Steer rudder
- **Shift+A/D**: Rotate sails (now up to 45째 in either direction)
- **F**: Board/Exit ship
- **SPACE**: Fire cannons
- **E**: Toggle between steering wheel and deck walking

Wind direction and sail angle now have a more significant impact on ship movement, encouraging tactical sail handling. The ship now behaves more like a real sailing vessel, only moving forward in the direction it's facing with turning controlled solely by the rudder.
